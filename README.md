Created with :blue_heart: by <a href="https://github.com/albertanguyen">Anh</a>

## Required User Stories

THE USER IS ABLE TO enjoy their experience hopefully at the end of the day

Several tests introduced (retrived from git log), mainly used enzyme and jest tools:
* snapshot test
* Funtion test: check button functionality by using Jestjs
* check buttons and their content
* test element's behavior


## Optional User Stories

THE USER CAN do nothing ... This is an internal battle field


## Time Spent and Lessons Learned
Coder School lecture starts at 10am and ends at 10pm ...

## Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* How to make the App failed... and use it to fix to code
* `find('button')` is not a strict find, test failed, code passed (0-1)
